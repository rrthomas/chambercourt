# ChamberCourt

https://github.com/rrthomas/chambercourt  

by Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>  

ChamberCourt is a framework for simple 2-D grid-based games, based on
[PyGame](https://pygame.org).

It is only intended for use by the author, mostly to resurrect a bunch of
old games he wrote a long time ago. I welcome help to make it more generally
useful: there is room for improvement in many areas. For example, it would
be nice if the games could run on the web (I have experimented with
[pygbag](https://github.com/pygame-web/pygbag/), but I didn’t get very far
yet), and some basic functionality would be nice such as a UI for rebinding
keys. However, I want to keep it as simple as possible!

The package is named after the central courtyard of my school, Winchester
College, because I wrote this package first while resurrecting a game,
[WinColl](https://github.com/rrthomas/wincoll), named after the school.


## Installation

Install with `pip`: `pip install chambercourt`.


## Creating games with ChamberCourt

The following documentation is available:

* [API documentation](https://rrthomas.github.io/chambercourt)
* [Cookbook](Cookbook.md)
* Demo game: a demonstration game is available, called `chambercourt`. You
  can run it directly from a Git checkout with
  `PYTHONPATH=. python -m chambercourt`.


## Creating and editing levels

Levels are created and edited in [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/). All
in-game graphics and sounds are stored in the levels directory by
convention. A demonstration level is in `chambercourt/levels`.

Some notes about level design:

+ A set of levels is numbered according to the lexical order of their file
  names.
+ Levels need exactly one start position, given by placing the hero.
